## Do you want to generate spatial transcriptomics data using your H&E images?

We introduce DeepSpot, a novel deep-learning model that predicts spatial transcriptomics from H&E images. DeepSpot employs a deep-set neural network to model spots as bags of sub-spots and integrates multi-level tissue details and spatial context. This integration, supported by the robust pre-trained H&E models, significantly enhances the accuracy and granularity of gene predictions from H&E images.

**Fig.: DeepSpot leverages pathology foundation models and spatial tissue context.**
**Workflow of DeepSpot**: H&E slides are first divided into tiles, each corresponding to a spot. For each spot, we create a bag of sub-spots by dividing it into sub-tiles that capture the local morphology, and a bag of neighboring spots to represent the global context. A pretrained pathology model extracts tile features, which are input to the model. The concatenated representations are then fed into the gene head predictor, ρgene, to predict spatial gene expression.

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/ratschlab/DeepSpot
cd DeepSpot
conda env create --file=environment.yaml
conda activate deepspot
python setup.py install
```

##### NB: Please ensure you have installed [pyvips](https://github.com/libvips/pyvips) depending on your machine's requirements. We suggest installing pyvips through conda:
```
conda install conda-forge::pyvips
```

Install jupyter kernel 
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name deepspot --display-name "deepspot"
```

## Pretrained DeepSpot weights

Moreover, we provide pretrained weights for DeepSpot, which were generated during the training of the model in our publication and were used, for example, to generate spatial transcriptomics data for TCGA skin melanoma and kidney cancer slides. 
Download DeepSpot weights [here](https://zenodo.org/records/15322099).

## Pathology foundation models

Please ensure that you download the weights for the pathology foundation models and update their file path deepspot/utils/utils_image.py. You may need to agree to specific terms and conditions before downloading.
