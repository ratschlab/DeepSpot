## Which DeepSpot module should I use?

DeepSpot provides three main modules for different spatial transcriptomics applications:

### `Visium_spot_example` - DeepSpot for Spot-level Resolution
Contains a tutorial on how to apply DeepSpot to spatial transcriptomics data generated with Visium at **spot-level resolution**.

### `Xenium_single-cell_example` - DeepCell for Single-cell Resolution  
Contains a tutorial on how to apply the adapted version of DeepSpot - DeepCell, to spatial transcriptomics data generated with Xenium at **single-cell resolution**. 

### `Visium_to_Xenium_spot2cell_example` - DeepSpot2Cell for Visium deconvolution
Contains a tutorial on how to apply DeepSpot2Cell to **deconvolve spot-level resolution** Visium data into Xenium-like single-cell resolution.
